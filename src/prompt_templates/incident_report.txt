Subject: Weird network outage happening right now

Hey IT team,

Just wanted to give you a heads up — the network’s been acting super weird since around 10:30 this morning. My laptop keeps dropping connection randomly, and I’ve heard a few others in the office having the same problem. It seems worse near the New York and Chicago offices.

What’s really odd is I noticed some strange pop-ups asking me to enter my login info, but they didn’t look like the usual company login screen — kinda sketchy. I didn’t enter anything, but it felt like some kind of phishing or hack attempt. Also saw my mouse move a bit on its own right before the connection dropped.

No idea if this is part of any planned maintenance or if something else is going on, but figured you’d want to know ASAP. Let me know if you need me to check anything on my end or provide more details.

Thanks!
James Smith with the Redmont Research Team
